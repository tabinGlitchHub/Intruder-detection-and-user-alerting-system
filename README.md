# Intruder-detection-and-user-alert-system

This project was made by the following members as a Final year project for B.E in Electronics degree.

Team Members:
1) Shaikh Tabin.
2) Raut Aditya.
3) Shetty Sidhant.

About:
  The project makes use of DNN (Deep Neural Network) for Object detection and LBPH algorithm for facial detection and recognition in order to distinguish 
  between a friendly face and the face of a stranger, this is done by training the system beforehand with the 'trainer.py' program from the package. The project       then warns the user via a SMS alert by using the GSM module which will be connected with the CPU (Either a PC or Rasberry Pi).

Software Used:
  Packages:
  - opencv-contrib-python
  - GSMTC35
  - numpy
 
  IDE:
  - PyCharm CE
    
Hardware Used:
  - SIM900A module.
